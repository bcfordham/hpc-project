Compilation:
Compile with make and the rule corresponding to whichever experiment you'd like to use.
e.g. if you want to compile using the sequential experiment, use 'make clean sequential', 
and for the parallel_for experiment use 'make clean parallel_for'

Execute with:
./schooling

Beware that OpenMP will try to use all available threads to execute.
